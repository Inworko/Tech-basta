In addition to academic skills, we also observe and measure students' behavioral skills and language proficiency. This preliminary evaluation provides a clear understanding of each student's baseline knowledge and capabilities, allowing us to tailor our educational resources and interventions to effectively address their specific needs and foster holistic development.</p>

They were given learning modules and assessment tools to evaluate the change after using the kit. After the session, students were given another assessment to check how much they had understood from the training session. Initially, the before and after assessments were paper worksheets, but as the students began to grow more accustomed to technology, assessments began to be conducted on tablets. The use of interactive educational technology enabled the kids to become better learners as it held their attention and forced them to think in different ways to solve the problem.</h4>

They were then provided with learning modules and assessment tools to measure their progress. At the end of the session, another assessment was administered to gauge their understanding of the material covered. Initially, these assessments were conducted using paper worksheets. However, as students became more familiar with technology, assessments transitioned to being conducted on tablets and desktops/Laptops. The implementation of interactive educational technology not only captured students' attention but also encouraged them to think critically and solve problems in diverse ways, thereby enhancing their overall learning experience.</h4>
